### About the files content

1. The directory "data" contains two files:

    - 'dataset_banco_cleanned.csv': Cleanned dataset.

2. Two jupyter notebook:
    - 'Cleanning_data.ipynb' : The file where I developed the cleanning process.
    - 'EDA.ipynb' : In this file, I made some Exploratory Data Analysis (Independent, Uni-variate and bi-variate analysis).

# About this project

In this project, I used the public dataset that it is available in the youtube channel of Codificando bits  (see in the description box of the video). The focus of this project is to describe or recognize the coustomerâ€™s profile of a bank. However, at first, I cleanned the dataset in order to implement the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as a second and final step.
